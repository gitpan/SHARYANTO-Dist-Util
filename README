         packlist_for
         list_dist_modules
     );

     say packlist_for("Text::ANSITable"); # sample output: /home/steven/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/lib/site_perl/5.18.2/x86_64-linux/auto/Text/ANSITable/.packlist

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  packlist_for($mod) => STR
    Find ".packlist" file for installed module $mod (which can be in the
    form of "Package::SubPkg" or "Package/SubPkg.pm"). Return undef if none
    is found.

    Depending on the content of @INC, the returned path may be absolute or
    relative.

  list_dist_modules($mod) => LIST
    Given installed module name $mod (which must be the name of the main
    module of its distribution), list all the modules in the distribution.
    This is done by first finding the ".packlist" file, then look at all the
    ".pm" files listed in the packlist.

    Will return empty list if fails to get the packlist.
